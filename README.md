# Introduction
Following an angular tutorial because of school(We didn't have to follow the tutorial. You could have made your own project)<br>
I've done all 6 parts of the tutorial which we had to do.

## Week 1 
The first week we did 1. The hero editor.
In this tutorial we started with generating a component with "ng generate component heroes" after this I had to create a hero interface and display said hero interface. I imported some modules. Made it so we could show the hero object.
## Week 2
The second week we did 2. Display a list.
I created a new file in which I could create some heroes I could display in a list. I added a click event which I binded and I added a event handler. The tutorial added styling but the styling wasn't the same as mine. Mine looked a bit weird.
## Week 3
The third week we did 3. Create a feature component.
I had to generate a component which has an input field and this had to be shown in the main page
## Week 4
The fourth week we did a part of 4. Add services.
I had to generate a new component again called hero.
## Week 5
The fifth week we had to follow the tutorial at https://angular.io/tutorial so that's what I did. I finished the 4th part of the tutorial.
The tutorial made me generate a new component again called messages. It also made me generate a service called messages. I had to inject some stuff into the files.
## Week 6
The sixth week I finished the fith and sixth part of the tutorial.
In the fifth part I generated a new module which has --flat and --module=app(more info further down). A RouterOutlet was added to the project with navigation links and a dashboard view. In the sixth part I enabled HTTP services. With this I had to return response data, handle errors and get heroes by id. Finally  I had to add, delete, update and search heroes.


## Parameter details
--flat 	Puts the file in src/app instead of its own directory.
--module=app 	Tells ng generate to register it in the imports array of the AppModule.
